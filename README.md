## Day 1: 7 Jan 2019:

- **Today's Progress:** Brushed up my existing Python skills before starting anything new in ML. Revised Python data types (lists, tuples, strings, etc) and functions.
- **Thoughts:**  Brushing up Python didn’t take as long as I had expected. Only took me a couple of hours to revise everything and even implement some small coding examples.

## Day 2: 8 Jan 2019:

- **Today's Progress:** Started with [Jose Portilla's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmportilla) ‘Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Course’ which can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/). Successfully installed Anaconda distribution and explore Jupyter Notebooks. Also completed NumPy videos and exercises.
- **Thoughts:** It was great to start learning something completely new. NumPy was fun to learn and not as difficult as I had thought it to be.

## Day 3: 9 Jan 2019

- **Today's Progress:** Started watching Pandas videos from the same course as mentioned earlier. Completed halfway through the videos and learnt today about Pandas series and DataFrames. Partially solved Pandas E-commerce exercise.
- **Thoughts:** Pandas was even much more fun and easy to learn as compared to NumPy. Since I had studied DBMS before in college, I found it quite easy to co-relate it with Pandas DataFrames.

## Day 4: 10 Jan 2019

- **Today's Progress:** Continued watching Pandas videos. Solved Pandas Salaries exercise and Pandas E-commerce exercises. Also started with Andrew NG's Machine Learning course on Coursera which can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). Completed upto Intoduction
- **Thoughts:** The second part of Pandas seemed tough to me. However, Andrew NG's style of teaching is just phenomenonal and I'm pretty sure I am to stick to his course for sometime now.
