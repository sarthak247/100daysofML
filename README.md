## Day 1: 7 Jan 2019:

- **Today's Progress:** Brushed up my existing Python skills before starting anything new in ML. Revised Python data types (lists, tuples, strings, etc) and functions.
- **Thoughts:**  Brushing up Python didn’t take as long as I had expected. Only took me a couple of hours to revise everything and even implement some small coding examples.

## Day 2: 8 Jan 2019:

- **Today's Progress:** Started with [Jose Portilla's]() ‘Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Course’ which can be found [here](). Successfully installed Anaconda distribution and explore Jupyter Notebooks. Also completed NumPy videos and exercises.
- **Thoughts:** It was great to start learning something completely new. NumPy was fun to learn and not as difficult as I had thought it to be.
